Ample is the internet's first body liberation app. Reviews of doctors, businesses, and services are collected; these establishments are rated on their inclusivity and accessibility... does that doctor understand Health At Every Size, or will they subject you to diet talk before they look your ailment? Does that massage therapist ask gender pronouns? Does the movie theater have too small of seats for large-bodied people to comfortably sit? Is there dedicated disability parking? Find out on Ample.
